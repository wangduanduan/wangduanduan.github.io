## 读后感

### 新技术出现的时机
> Pulling the trigger early might put you at risk of making the wrong decision in terms of
> vendor or protocol. Adopting late might put you behind the competition or make you
> rush to deploy a system that is not well understood by the local staff.


技术应用出现的太早则会承受巨大的风险，出现的太晚则失去竞争力。

### 两种SIP信令
> VoIP protocols are broken into two categories: signaling and transport.


VoIP的信令可以分为两类，传输信令 与 传输媒体


### 美梦与噩梦
>  It was a golden dream for some (consumers) and a nightmare for others; namely, the providers.


新技术的出现，对开拓者来说是黄金美梦，对守旧者来说，则是噩梦。

### 出局
>  Some of these services offered calling plans for less than half the price of traditional carriers. Some of them, most notably Skype, had as one of their goals putting telephone companies out of business


### UDP的另一种理解
>  In fact,UDP is sometimes considered a fire-and-forget protocol because once the packet leaves the sender, we think nothing more about it.


UDP可以理解成一种一旦发送，则忘记的协议。
