# 简介

> An IMDG (in-memory data grid) is a set of networked/clustered computers that pool together their random access memory (RAM) to let applications share data structures with other applications running in the cluster.
> 
> The primary advantage is speed, which has become critical in an environment with billions of mobile, IoT devices and other sources continuously streaming data. With all relevant information in RAM in an IMDG, there is no need to traverse a network to remote storage for transaction processing. The difference in speed is significant – minutes vs. sub-millisecond response times for complex transactions done millions of times per second.
